hint: can be used to tackle problems that take exponential time O(2^n)

- nested loops filling out a table
- often initialise first row and col as 0s (starting point)

We can apply the dynamic programming technique in such situations if the problem has certain properties:

- Simple Subproblems: Needs to be a way of repeatedly breaking global optimization problem
into subproblems. Should be a way to parametrize subproblems with just a few indices (i,j,k)

- Subproblem Optimization: An optimal solution to the global problem must be a composition of optimal
subproblem solutions

- Subproblem Overlap: Optimal solutions to unrelated subproblems can contain subproblems in common
