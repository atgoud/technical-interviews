Sorting can be faster if we know particular characteristics of the input
    - Fast as assumes something about the input

Counting sort: Buckets hold a single value
    - just needs to store an integer rather than a bunch of values

Bucket sort: Buckets hold a range of values
    - needs linked lists or dyanmic arrays (large amount of memory)
    - to hold sets of items within each bucket
    - not non comparison (if use another sort)
    - assumes input distributed uniformly (if not bad complexity happens)

Radix sort: Buckets hold values based on digits within their values
