tbh I probably wont get asked to implement an AVL tree
but its good practice to do so
i should read up on tries and n array trees if i dont have time to implement them but I should defs have a
great understanding of
- hash tables
- linked lists
- queues
- stacks
- binary seach tree

and probs some dynamic programming and other questions like n queens etc
